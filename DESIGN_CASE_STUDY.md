## The Challenge

### Problem Statement
Restaurant discovery in New York City presents a complex user experience problem. Traditional platforms rely on rigid, keyword-based filters that fail to capture the nuanced nature of dining preferences and create friction in the user journey.

### Key Pain Points Identified
1. **Cognitive Overload** - Users overwhelmed by complex filter systems and endless lists
2. **Lack of Context Understanding** - Systems unable to interpret natural requests like "cozy date spot in SoHo under $50"
3. **Generic Recommendations** - Results lack personalization and compelling narratives
4. **Dead-End Experiences** - No intelligent fallbacks when searches yield no results
5. **Fragmented User Journey** - Disconnected experience from discovery to logging visits

### User Personas & Requirements
- **Primary Users:** NYC residents and visitors seeking personalized dining recommendations
- **Core Need:** Effortless discovery of restaurants that match specific context, mood, and preferences
- **Success Criteria:** Reduced time-to-recommendation, increased user engagement, higher satisfaction with suggestions

---

## Design Solution

### Design Philosophy
**Human-Centered Conversational Design** - Moving beyond traditional UI paradigms to create a natural language interface that understands context, maintains conversation flow, and provides intelligent guidance.

### Key Design Principles
1. **Conversational First** - Natural language as the primary interaction method
2. **Context Awareness** - System remembers conversation history and user preferences
3. **Intelligent Fallbacks** - Always provide alternatives when direct matches aren't found
4. **Transparent Reasoning** - Clear explanations for each recommendation
5. **Progressive Enhancement** - Graceful degradation across devices and connection speeds

├── ui/                  # Reusable UI primitives
├── app-sidebar.tsx      # Navigation component
├── restaurant-card.tsx  # Restaurant display component
└── theme-provider.tsx   # Dark mode support
```

**State Management Strategy:**
- **React Context** for authentication state
- **Supabase Client** for real-time data synchronization
- **Local State** for UI interactions and form handling

### Backend Architecture

**Database Choice: Supabase (PostgreSQL)**
- **Rationale:** Real-time capabilities, built-in authentication, excellent TypeScript support
- **Benefits:** Reduced backend complexity, automatic API generation, real-time subscriptions

**Data Model Design:**
```typescript
// Core entities designed for flexibility and scalability
Profile: User preferences and dietary restrictions
Restaurant: Comprehensive restaurant data with location
Experience: User visits and ratings
Recommendation: AI-generated suggestions with reasoning
ChatMessage: Conversation history and context
```

**Authentication & Security:**
- Row-level security (RLS) policies
- JWT-based session management
- Environment variable protection for API keys

### AI Integration Architecture

**Google Generative AI (Gemini) Implementation:**
```typescript
// Conversation flow designed for natural interaction
1. Natural Language Input → AI Processing
2. Context Extraction → Structured Query
3. Database Search → Results Ranking
4. Narrative Generation → User Response
```

**Intelligent Features:**
- **Context Retention:** Conversation history maintained across sessions
- **Progressive Questioning:** Strategic follow-ups when information is missing
- **Fallback Mechanisms:** Partial matches when exact criteria can't be met
- **Reasoning Transparency:** Every recommendation includes explanation

## User Experience Design

### Conversation Design Principles

**Following Human-Centered Conversation Design:**
- **Prompts:** Controlled, precise language that minimizes cognitive load
- **User Intent Recognition:** Data-driven intent classification with flexible utterance matching
- **Conversational Pathways:** Mapped interaction flows with branch handling
- **Personality:** Trustworthy, knowledgeable restaurant guide persona

### Interface Design Decisions

**Visual Design System:**
```css
/* Custom brand colors for Restaurant Rex */
--rex-red: #E53935;      /* Primary brand color */
--rex-black: #121212;    /* Typography and accents */
--rex-cream: #F5F5DC;    /* Warm background tones */
```

**Component Design Strategy:**
